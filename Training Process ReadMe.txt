For Training the deep learning model : - 

All four models cannot be trained in one system as it can run out of GPU memory at sometime 
and it takes almost 5 to 8 hour to train one model.

Some models are trained on Kaggle cloud as it provide 30hrs per week quota. 
Training Process is much faster on Cloud (Approx 4 to 5 hours).

For Training process separate folders should be created and some of directory should be changed like dataset and pre-trained weights directory.

There is no need to train the models again as all files are been generated and all present in the project folder.
